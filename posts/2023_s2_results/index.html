<p>Congratulations to our Grand Final winner and League Champion: Evert Jan Loef with the Humerus Laughing Stock!</p>
<p>The Cup Grand Final was played between Humerus Laughing Stock and The Eight Peaks Warlords. The game went into Extra Time after ending 1-1 in regulation time. The whole game was played in pouring rain, and really could have gone either way. Bomber Dribblesnot was induced to play for the Warlords and after an indifferent 1st half, really put in work during the 2nd Half and in over time. He removed at least 4 Tomb Kings players, and combined with some atrocious KO rolls by EJ, had the Tomb Kings down several of their best players.</p>
<p>EJ won the toss and received in the extra time half, holding two rerolls. The Warlords were up on players but out of rerolls. It looked like it could a coin toss result. The Kick-off result was a Time Out, reducing the half to 7 turns. The Tomb Kings did what they do and got into the grind. However Bomber Dribblesnot consistently knocked holes in the cage and eventually knocked the ball loose. The Rat Ogre chain pushed the ball into the clear and the star gutter runner Sniktastic Quickblaze, the league leading touchdown scorer, pounced on the ball. All he needed to do was survive the next turn and the win was very likely for the Underworld team.</p>
<p>[Spoilers: he did not survive the next turn]</p>
<p>EJ went in for the blitz with his Frenzy / Dirty Player skelly lineman Nelson Mandible, who wiffed the on first two dice, but found the pow on the second two dice. Then rolled a 7+ to break armour and remove Sniktastic Quickblaze as a CAS. Quickblaze had been armour busted earlier in the league by this very same Nelson Mandible! Some times Nuffle likes a rags to riches to rags story.</p>
<p>The Tomb Kings were able to recover the ball in the rain, and on the last turn needed, with no remaining rerolls, to make the following sequence</p>
<p>2+ rush, 2+ rush, 2d block without block needing a push, 2+ rush 2+ rush to blitz a goblin with a Tomb Guardian needing a pow to push the ball carrier out of a tackle zone, 2+ rush, 2+ rush to a 5+ hand off, and made it!
Samba Action calculator tells me that this was a 3% play, but hey 3% plays come off 50/50. Either they work or they don&rsquo;t!</p>
<p>The final result was 2-1 TD and (5-4 Cas) to Humerus Laughing Stock</p>
<p>Congratulations again to EJ, it was an epic match and deserving of a Grand Final.</p>
<p>In the Plate Final the Beasty Bash Crew showed up and put a 3-1 victory over the Dakka Dahlias. (3-1 Cas).</p>
<p>The 3rd / 4th playoff between D.E.A.D and The Blue Boobies (as in the bird) was won by D.E.A.D 2-1 and (1-1 Cas).</p>
<p>The Shield Final was decided between the Mount Roskill Murder Bulls and The Jurassic Park Rangers. 2-0 to the Bulls (2-0 Cas).</p>
<p>At the bottom of the table we had Bubbas B.O. and Remuera Fight Club facing off to avoid the Wooden Spoon.   The match went 2-0 to Bubbas B.O. (2-1 Cas), leaving the Spoon in the hands of the Khorn team with a bemused look on their face and no idea what to use it for (too small to be a club, and what even is cooking?).</p>
