      <description>Season 2301 1 Final ResultsContgratulations to our Grand Final winner and League Champion: James Cardno with his Mount Roskill Murder Bulls!
Thanks to James for putting together this little match report:
&amp;ldquo;Hashut the god of fire, greed and tyranny demanded more sacrifices in return for his divine patronage. This week he gave the Chaos Dwarfs a gift in the form of a powerful daemonsmith able to conjure great fireballs and even turn prancing elves into frogs (an improvement in some coaches eyes).</description>
